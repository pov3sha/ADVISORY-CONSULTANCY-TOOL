ü§ñ SmartConsult AI: Your Personal AI Strategy Consultant
SmartConsult AI is a powerful, self-hosted consulting platform that leverages multiple large language models (Ollama, Google Gemini, Groq) to provide high-level business analysis and strategic recommendations. It features a sleek, modern dashboard for managing analyses and viewing detailed, visualized reports.

‚ú® Core Features
Multi-Analysis Engine: Go beyond simple prompts. Generate three distinct types of high-level consulting reports:

Autonomous Case Analysis: Provide a problem statement, and the AI will perform its own internal reasoning to deliver a comprehensive strategic plan, complete with a diagnosis, a 30-60-90 day timeline, and success metrics.

SWOT Analysis: Get a detailed breakdown of a company's Strengths, Weaknesses, Opportunities, and Threats.

PESTLE Analysis: Understand the macro-environmental factors (Political, Economic, Social, Technological, Legal, Environmental) affecting an entire industry.

Multi-Provider LLM Backend: You're in control. Seamlessly switch between different LLM providers based on your needs for speed, cost, or local hosting. Supports:

Ollama (for running local models like Llama 3.1)

Google Gemini (for powerful, cloud-based analysis)

Groq (for incredibly high-speed responses)

Professional Dashboard UI: A clean, intuitive, and beautiful dark-mode interface for creating new analyses, viewing your case history, and examining reports.

Persistent Storage: All your cases and reports are saved permanently in a local SQLite database, so your work is never lost.

Dynamic Report Generation: Reports are generated as standalone HTML files, complete with interactive timeline visualizations for 30-60-90 day plans powered by ApexCharts.js.
